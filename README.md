# vue_quote_api

> A project for Free Code Camp. A small SPA which gets random quotes from a quote API

> It's built in Vue, this was my first time using Vue so some of what I've used is taken from Traversy Media's channel on YouTube.

> Initially it was written in jQuery but I transferred the concept over and thought Vue would be a good fit.

> It fufills the criteria laid out by Free Code Camp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine) in that it pulls random quotes on demand from an API endpoint using Axios and then offers the functionality to 'tweet' the retrieved quote.
